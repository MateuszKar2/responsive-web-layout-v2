 # Web Layout V2

This is the second version of the basic web layout project. In this version, I have enhanced the layout by adding new features and improving responsiveness.

- **Improved responsiveness**: Better adaptation of the layout to different screen sizes.
- **CSS Grid and Flexbox integration**: Used for more advanced layout structures.
- **New sections**: Added new content sections like a footer, enhanced navigation, and updated header.
- **Visual enhancements**: Updated color scheme and typography for a more modern look.
- **Accessibility improvements**: Improved navigation for screen readers and keyboard users.
